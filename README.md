<h3>Yo 🙋‍♂️</h3>

My name is Nick, and over the past 8+ years of my career, I have had the opportunity to work on and lead a variety of projects, including websites, mobile apps, Figma plugins, IDE extensions, Chrome add-ons, Telegram bots, back-end services, and more.

Currently I am having fun solving bioinformatics problems using Python here at [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/users/vonderklaas/)
